# BirdCalls
Classify bird calls sounds on wave files using SSAST fine tuning

## Introduction  
This repository contains the implementation (in PyTorch) of classifying bird calls using **Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST)** ([SSAST: Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer](https://github.com/YuanGongND/ssast)) fine-tuning.

The database we used is by courtesy of Zoological school of Tel=Aviv University

## Details
Repository contains the following:
1) Pre-processing code
2) Modified SSAST source files
3) Result analysis code
4) Jupyter notebooks for running on Google Colab
